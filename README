This script needs python-tweepy library.

Working of the Bot:

The program loop starts by checking the replies timeline. 

If replies are found, the program checks the tweet ID in dataFile to know whether it's processed already.

case 1 : Not processed

     The program extracts the keyword from tweet, looks in dictionary and tweets as a reply to the user. The ID of this tweet will be added in the dataFile.

case 2: Processed

     Do nothing, back to the start of loop.

Issues:

1. The program terminates unexpectedly.
   
   > While processing some defintions, unicode issues arises.

TODO:

1. Fix minor unicode issues.
